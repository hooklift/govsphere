<h2>Enum Description</h2>
<p></p>
         The <a href="vim.cluster.DasFdmAvailabilityState.html">ClusterDasFdmAvailabilityState</a> enumeration describes the
  availability states of hosts in a vSphere HA cluster. In the HA
  architecture, a agent called the Fault Domain Manager runs on
  each active host. These agents elect a master and the others become
  its slaves. The availability state assigned to a given host is
  determined from information reported by the Fault Domain Manager
  running on the host, by a Fault Domain Manager that has been elected
  master, and by vCenter Server. See <a href="vim.cluster.DasFdmHostState.html">ClusterDasFdmHostState</a>
  for more information about the vSphere HA architecture.

<tr class="r1">
<td><a id="connectedToMaster" name="connectedToMaster"></a>connectedToMaster</td><td>
      The normal operating state for a slave host. In this state,
  the host is exchanging heartbeats with a master over
  the management network, and is thus connected to it. If
  there is a management network partition, the slave will be
  in this state only if it is in the same partition as the master.
  This state is reported by the master of a slave host.
   <br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="r0">
<td><a id="election" name="election"></a>election</td><td>
      The Fault Domain Manager on the host has been initialized and
  the host is either waiting to join the existing master or
  is participating in an election for a new master. This state
  is reported by vCenter Server or by the host itself.

<td><a id="fdmUnreachable" name="fdmUnreachable"></a>fdmUnreachable</td><td>
      The Fault Domain Manager (FDM) on the host cannot be reached. This
  state is reported in two unlikley situations.
  <ul>
  <li> First, it is reported by
  a master if the host responds to ICMP pings sent by the master over the
  management network but the FDM on the host cannot be reached by the master.
  This situation will occur if the FDM is unable to run or exit the
  uninitialized state.
  <li> Second, it is reported by vCenter Server if it cannot connect to a
  master nor the FDM for the host. This situation would occur if all hosts
  in the cluster failed but vCenter Server is still running. It may also
  occur if all FDMs are unable to run or exit the uninitialized state.
  </ul>

      The slave host appears to be down. This state is reported by the
  master of a slave host.

<td><a id="initializationError" name="initializationError"></a>initializationError</td><td>
      An error occurred when initilizating the Fault Domain Manager
  on a host due to a problem with installing the
  agent or configuring it. This condition can often be cleared by
  reconfiguring HA for the host. This state is reported by vCenter
  Server.

      A host is alive but is isolated from the management network.
  See <a href="vim.cluster.DasVmSettings.IsolationResponse.html">ClusterDasVmSettingsIsolationResponse</a> for the criteria
  used to determine whether a host is isolated.

      A slave host is alive and has management network connectivity, but
  the management network has been partitioned. This state is reported
  by masters that are in a partition other than the one containing the
  slave host; the master in the slave's partition will report the slave state
  as <a href="vim.cluster.DasFdmAvailabilityState.html#connectedToMaster">connectedToMaster</a>.

<tr class="r1">
<td><a id="uninitializationError" name="uninitializationError"></a>uninitializationError</td><td>
      An error occurred when unconfiguring the Fault Domain Manager
  running on a host. In order to clear this condition the host might
  need to be reconnected to the cluster and reconfigured first.
  This state is reported by vCenter
  Server.

<td><a id="uninitialized" name="uninitialized"></a>uninitialized</td><td>
      The Fault Domain Manager for the host has not yet been
  initialized. Hence the host is not part of a vSphere HA
  fault domain. This state is reported by vCenter Server or
  by the host itself.
